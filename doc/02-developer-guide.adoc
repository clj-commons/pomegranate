== Audience
You want contribute to, or learn about, the development of the pomegranate library.

== Contributing

We very much appreciate contributions from the community.

=== Issue First Please

If you have an idea or a fix, please do raise a GitHub issue before investing in any coding effort.
That way we can discuss first.
Writing code is the easy part, maintaining it forever is the hard part.

That said, if you notice a simple typo, a PR without an issue is fine.

=== Submitting a Pull Request

Please never force push on your PR, as this makes reviewing incremental changes impossible for us.
When we merge your PR, we'll usually squash it, so that will clean up any rambling work in progress.

== Environmental Overview

=== Developer Prerequisites

The current version of Babashka.
The current version of Clojure.
JDK8+

=== Foundational Library

Leiningen and other tools rely on pomegranate behaving the way it does.
We must be very careful when making changes.

== Docs

All documentation is written in AsciiDoc. (coming soon)
@lread likes to follow https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[AsciiDoc best practice of one sentence per line] but won't be entirely pedantic about that.

We host our docs on cljdoc. (coming soon)

== The Public API

When making changes to pomegranate understand that any public method is considered part of the public API.

We must be careful not to expose what we feel are implementation details.

== Babashka Tasks

We use Babashka tasks, to see all available tasks run:

[source,shell]
----
bb tasks
----

Optionally:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb clean
$ bb download-deps
----

Run all Clojure tests

[source,shell]
----
$ bb test
----

You can also include cognitect test runner options:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb test --var 'clj-yaml.core-test/emoji-can-be-parsed'
----

...and/or Clojure version:

[source,shell]
----
$ bb test --clj-version 1.9
----
(defaults to `1.8`, specify `:all` to test against all supported Clojure versions)

Our CI workflow lints sources with clj-kondo, and eastwood - and you can too!

[source,shell]
----
$ bb lint-kondo
$ bb lint-eastwood
----

Or to run both: `bb lint`
